# Assessment of the Shipping decarbonization along the Maritime Silk Road"

## Overview
`SolutionMethodMultiShipCode.m` is a MATLAB analysis script for Silk Road shipping decarbonization studies. It covers:
- fleet organization by ship class (container, bulk, liquid)
- annual trips and port calls
- fuel use, emissions, and GLH demand allocation
- cost estimation (fuel, GLH, retrofitting, and port infrastructure)
- multiple visualization sections (bar, pie, contour, and distribution plots)

## Main Inputs (in script context)
- Port, country, and ship information tables (e.g., `PortInf`, `CountryInf`, `ShipInf`)
- Trade demand matrices (e.g., container, coal, iron ore, crude oil, LNG, LPG)
- Route distance matrix and related coefficients
- External Excel data files referenced by the script

## Main Outputs
- Calculated trip counts, port calls, fleet size, emissions, and GLH allocation
- Port-level infrastructure sizing and investment results
- Optional shapefiles and figures generated by visualization sections
